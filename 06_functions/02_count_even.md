Problem Statement:
You need to write a function count_even(lst) that:

Prompts the user to enter integers until they press enter (no input is given).

After collecting the integers, it counts and prints how many of them are even numbers.

Breakdown of the Solution:
Input Collection:

The program will prompt the user to enter integers one by one until the user presses enter without typing anything. This will stop the input collection process.

Counting Even Numbers:

The count_even(lst) function will loop through the list of integers and count how many of those are even (i.e., numbers that are divisible by 2).

Code Implementation:
python
Copy
def count_even(lst):
    """
    Returns the number of even numbers in the list.
    Example:
    >>> count_even([1,2,3,4])
    2
    >>> count_even([1,3,5,7])
    0
    """
    count = 0  # Initialize the count of even numbers
    for num in lst:  # Loop through each number in the list
        if num % 2 == 0:  # If the number is even
            count += 1  # Increment the count
    print(count)  # Print the number of even numbers in the list

def get_list_of_ints():
    """
    Reads in integers from the user until they press enter without typing anything.
    Returns the list of integers entered.
    """
    lst = []  # Initialize an empty list to store the integers
    user_input = input("Enter an integer or press enter to stop: ")  # Prompt the user for input
    while user_input != "":  # While the user doesn't press enter without typing anything
        lst.append(int(user_input))  # Convert the input to an integer and add to the list
        user_input = input("Enter an integer or press enter to stop: ")  # Ask for the next number
    return lst  # Return the list of integers

def main():
    lst = get_list_of_ints()  # Get the list of integers from the user
    count_even(lst)  # Call the function to count and print the number of even numbers

# This line is required to ensure that the script runs only when executed directly
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
