Problem Breakdown:
The task is to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence starting from Fib(0) = 0 and Fib(1) = 1 and continue printing the sequence until the numbers reach or exceed 10,000.

Fibonacci Sequence Recap:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The first two numbers are 0 and 1. Here's a small segment of the Fibonacci sequence:

Fib(0) = 0

Fib(1) = 1

Fib(2) = Fib(1) + Fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1

Fib(3) = Fib(2) + Fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2

Fib(4) = Fib(3) + Fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3

And so on...

Task:
Start by printing Fib(0) = 0 and Fib(1) = 1.

Continue printing terms in the sequence, making sure each term does not exceed 10,000.

Plan:
Define the constant MAX_TERM_VALUE to represent the upper bound (10,000).

Initialize the first two terms in the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1).

Use a loop to generate and print the Fibonacci numbers, checking that the current number does not exceed MAX_TERM_VALUE.

Stop the loop once the next term would exceed MAX_TERM_VALUE.

Solution Code:
python
Copy
MAX_TERM_VALUE : int = 10000  # Maximum value for the Fibonacci terms

def main():
    curr_term = 0  # The 0th Fibonacci number
    next_term = 1  # The 1st Fibonacci number
    
    # Continue generating Fibonacci terms as long as curr_term is less than or equal to MAX_TERM_VALUE
    while curr_term <= MAX_TERM_VALUE:
        print(curr_term, end=" ")  # Print the current Fibonacci number
        # Generate the next Fibonacci number
        term_after_next = curr_term + next_term
        curr_term = next_term  # Update curr_term to the next term
        next_term = term_after_next  # Update next_term to the term after that

# Python boilerplate to call the main function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
