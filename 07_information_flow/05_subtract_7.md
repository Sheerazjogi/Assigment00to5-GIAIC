Problem Statement:
We need to implement the helper function subtract_seven() which will subtract 7 from the given number. The main function should call this helper function and display the result.

Starter Code:

def main():
    print(message)

# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Solution:

def main():
    # Initialize the number
    num = 7
    
    # Call the subtract_seven function to subtract 7 from num
    num = subtract_seven(num)
    
    # Print the result
    print("this should be zero:", num)

# Helper function to subtract 7 from the given number
def subtract_seven(num):
    num = num - 7
    return num

# This provided line is required at the end of the file to call main() function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
